This file documents every stage of the **CVA6 RISC-V Core — Synthesis-to-GDSII** flow, captured directly from the cloud EDA environment (Design Compiler + IC Compiler II).

## Screenshot 1 — Initial Floorplan: Macro Placement Overview

24 SRAM macros placed across the floorplan — `gen_256x45` and `gen_256x128` instruction/data SRAM banks on the left, `as_4x128 sram_bank[0–3]` banks on the right. This macro layout is what drove every congestion and density decision later in the flow.

## Screenshot 4 — Cell Density Heatmap (Issue Identified)

Density map of the design — green/yellow/orange regions near the macros flagged the high cell-density zones that needed to be addressed before routing.

## Screenshot 5 — Channel Congestion Map (After Fix)

Congestion map (total demand minus total supply) after applying the fix — almost the entire design sits in the "0" congestion bin, confirming the congestion issue was resolved.

## Screenshot 6 — Clock Tree Synthesis: Buffer Levels

Clock tree structure showing the buffer/inverter stages from the clock root down to the leaf sinks — built out to **20 levels** to manage skew and insertion delay across the macro-heavy block.

## Screenshot 8 — Sign-off Report: Cell Count Summary

Final cell count report — **219,738 leaf cells**, **24 sequential macros**, 23,554 sequential cells (325 clock-gating cells), 196,184 combinational cells, 0 isolation/level-shifter violations.

## Screenshot 9 — Sign-off Report: Area Summary

Final area utilization report showing the breakdown of standard-cell area, macro area, physical-only cell area, and total net length after successful routing and sign-off.

## Screenshot 10 — Global Timing Report

Final post-route global timing summary generated after sign-off optimization. The design achieves **no hold violations**, with only **5 negligible setup violations** (2 reg-to-reg and 3 input-to-register paths), each reporting a worst negative slack of approximately **-0.00 ns**, indicating timing closure is effectively achieved within reporting precision.

## Screenshot 11 — Design Rule Violation (DRV) Summary

Final design rule verification report after sign-off optimization. The design reports **zero design rule violations**, including **0 max transition**, **0 max capacitance**, **0 min capacitance**, and **0 minimum pulse width** violations, confirming compliance with all electrical design constraints.

## Screenshot 12 — DRC Verification Report

Final Design Rule Check (DRC) verification confirming a **clean routed database**. The report shows **0 DRC violations**, **0 antenna violations**, and no extraction or connectivity issues across **225,289 routed nets**, indicating the layout satisfies all physical design rule requirements.
